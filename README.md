This project focuses on analyzing and segmenting customers of an E-Commerce platform to better understand their purchasing behaviors.
By using machine learning and clustering techniques, customers are grouped based on their spending patterns, purchase frequency, and product preferences.

This segmentation enables businesses to:

Personalize marketing campaigns

Increase customer retention

Optimize recommendation systems

Predict future purchases from new customers

🚀 Business Use Case

Customer Segmentation divides a company's customer base into groups that share similar characteristics, such as:

Demographics – Age, gender, income, etc.

Behavioral Traits – Purchase frequency, order value, etc.

Geographical – Country or region.

Psychographic – Interests and preferences.

The main goal is to enhance customer engagement and maximize business value through data-driven marketing strategies.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains over 4000 customer records of online retail transactions made over a year.

Column	Description
InvoiceNo	Unique transaction ID. Starts with 'C' if the transaction was canceled.
StockCode	Unique product code.
Description	Product name.
Quantity	Quantity of items purchased per transaction.
InvoiceDate	Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice	Price per item (in £).
CustomerID	Unique identifier for each customer.
Country	Customer’s country of residence.
⚙️ Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter


💡 Recommended: Use the Anaconda Distribution
 which includes most of these packages pre-installed.

🧠 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Remove missing values and canceled transactions.

Convert date columns and compute metrics like total spend per customer.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized top countries, product categories, and order frequency.

Generated word clouds and keyword frequency plots to understand product trends.

Feature Engineering

Created features like:

Average basket size (mean)

Percentage spent across product categories (categ_0 to categ_4)

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Reduced customer features into 2D space for visualization.

Identified distinct customer behavior clusters.

Customer Segmentation

Clustered customers into 11 groups based on behavior.

Used clustering algorithms like K-Means and classification models for prediction.

Model Training & Evaluation

Compared multiple classifiers:

Logistic Regression

KNN

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

AdaBoost

Evaluated with learning curves and achieved ~75% accuracy.

📈 Visual Results
🌍 Country Distribution

The top 5 countries dominating transactions are:

Belgium – 119

☁️ Product Description Word Clouds

Word clouds reveal popular product terms across different countries.

🔬 PCA Visualization

Customer clusters visualized in 2D space showing clear behavioral separation.

🧩 Model Learning Curves

📚 Conclusion

Segmented ~4000 customers into 11 behavioral clusters based on purchase patterns.

Trained classifiers to predict customer segments from their first purchase.

Achieved ~75% prediction accuracy.

Seasonal variations (e.g., Christmas) may affect model performance — longer data periods could improve results.

✅ Future Work:

Add temporal modeling to account for seasonality.

🛍️ E-Commerce Customer Segmentation
📖 Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior from an E-Commerce dataset to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.
By identifying customer clusters and predicting future purchase behaviors, the project aims to help businesses enhance marketing personalization, customer retention, and sales growth.

🎯 Objectives

Segment customers based on purchase patterns and behavior.

Identify top-performing customer groups.

Predict new customers’ potential buying categories based on their first transaction.

Generate business insights through data visualization and machine learning.

🧠 Business Use Case

Customer segmentation enables companies to:

Deliver targeted marketing campaigns

Improve cross-selling and up-selling

Offer personalized recommendations

Enhance customer experience and lifetime value

Segmentation is done using four types of variables:

Demographic: Age, income, gender

Behavioral: Frequency, recency, monetary value

Geographical: Customer’s country

Psychographic: Lifestyle and preferences

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes details of over 4,000 customers and transactions recorded over one year.

Feature	Description
InvoiceNo	Unique transaction code; starts with ‘C’ if canceled
StockCode	Product (item) code
Description	Product name
Quantity	Number of items per transaction
InvoiceDate	Date and time of purchase
UnitPrice	Product price per unit (in £)
CustomerID	Unique ID assigned to each customer
Country	Country of residence
⚙️ Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
